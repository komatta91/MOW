Since 'R Language Support' v1.0.5 plugin for IntelliJ  has problems with indexing 'base' and 'tools' packets, this dir
contains whatever got spit out by the manual indexing process, as it was described here:
http://holgerbrandl.github.io/r4intellij/faq.html#r4intellij-fails-to-index-package-xy-what-canshould-i-do

Both files should be copied into 'r_skeletons' dir in External Libraries element of the IntelliJ project structure.

Until plugin will be fixed, code completion for 'base' and 'tools' packet should be considered incomplete.
